# Enforcing Secure 2FA Across the Alphabet Enterprise

As part of our ongoing efforts to secure Alphabet's source code, on June 30th 2025, we will **require all users accessing Alphabet-owned GitHub Organizations use only secure MFA methods**.

Secure methods include the following: 
*  Authenticator Apps (TOTP)
*  Passkeys
*  Security Keys
*  GitHub Mobile App (acting as 2fa)


Insecure methods include the following:
*  SMS

## What will happen after this change?
Users will receive an email from GitHub notifying them of this change. 
Users will be immediately locked out from accessing organization resources and will be prompted to set up a secure method or remove insecure methods. Once this is complete, access is immediately restored. 

 > [!NOTE]
 > This will also impact external collaborators and non-Googler members of Alphabet-owned Organizations. 

## What should I do ahead of time? 
We strongly recommend reviewing your MFA methods ahead of this change to ensure that:

1.  You have at least one secure method
1.  (Remove SMS as a 2FA method)[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/changing-your-two-factor-authentication-method]

> [!NOTE]
> You must add an Authenticator App prior to GitHub permitting the removal of an SMS based authentication method

## What is the rollout plan?
1.  Shortly after sending this email, there will be a butter bar added to notify users of the changes in GitHub
1.  We will send reminder emails notifying users of this change (2 and 1 week prior to enforcement)
1.  We will begin a phased roll out on June 30th, 2025 to gather initial feedback
1.  Pending the success of 3, weâ€™ll aim to rollout to all Organizations by July 14th, 2025
